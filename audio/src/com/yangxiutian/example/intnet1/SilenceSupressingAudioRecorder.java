	    You may be surprised that here, just 'AudioSystem.write()' is
	    called. But internally, it works like this: AudioSystem.write()
	    contains a loop that is trying to read from the passed
	    AudioInputStream. Since we have a special AudioInputStream
	    that gets its data from a TargetDataLine, reading from the
	    AudioInputStream leads to reading from the TargetDataLine. The
	    data read this way is then written to the passed File. Before
	    writing of audio data starts, a header is written according
	    to the desired audio file type. Reading continues untill no
	    more data can be read from the AudioInputStream. In our case,
	    this happens if no more data can be read from the TargetDataLine.
	    This, in turn, happens if the TargetDataLine is stopped or closed
	    (which implies stopping). (Also see the comment above.) Then,
	    the file is closed and 'AudioSystem.write()' returns.
