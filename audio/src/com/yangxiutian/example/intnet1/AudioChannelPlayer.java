/**	<titleabbrev>AudioChannelPlayer</titleabbrev>
	<title>Plays several soundfiles in sequence</title>
   
OLD DOCUMENTATION:
	<td bgcolor="orange">
	  <h2>AudioChannel -- playing sound files in a sequence</h2>

	  <p>
	    AudioChannel manages a queue of AudioInputStreams to send
	    them to the same line.  In the constructor of
	    AudioChannel, an AudioFormat has to be passed. A Line is
	    retrieved for this format. AudioInputStreams having a
	    different format are automatically converted during
	    playback.  This class is in an experimental state. Please
	    report problems.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    AudioChannelPlayer is a command-line program that shows
	    how to use AudioChannel. It plays all sound files whose
	    names are given as command line arguments in sequence.
